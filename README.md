## General Information
- The purpose of this project is to understand the basics and different approches of EDA used frequently/widely to explore the data
- As there is huge demand in loan there are high chances of defaulters so lending club case study project is the best way to understand EDA more briefly so we have to analyize and predict who is the potential defaulters and how to avoid them.
- We have used below steps for this analysis:
  - 1st Step: **Data Cleaning**
  - 2nd Step: **Univariate Analysis**
  - 3rd Step: **Segemented Univariate Analysis**
  - 4th Step: **Bivaraiate Analysis**
  - Final Step: **Conclusion**

## Conclusions
- The Defaulted loan are lower for the borrowers which own their property compared to mortgage or rent.
- The 60 months term has higher chance of defaulting than 36 months term whereas the 36 months term has higher chance of fully paid loan.
- The loans in 36 months term majorty consist of grade A and B loans whereas the loans in 60 months term mostly consist of grade B, C and D loans.
- Low grade loans have high tendency to default. Grading system is working as expected.
- Extra verification and background check must be done for the applicants belonging to CA state, as tendency to default is high.
- The default loan amount increases with interest rate and shows are decline after 17.5% interest rate.
- Loans having higher interest rate have more defaulters. Check the background of applicant thoroughly if interest rate is high.
- Risk are with the Borrowers having Public Recorded Bankruptcy.
